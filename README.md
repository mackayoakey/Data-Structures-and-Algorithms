# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms - Coursera University of Colorado Boulder

Data Structures & Algorithms is a MOOC from UC Boulder through Coursera. You can find more information at the following link:

You can also check out the UC Boulder course page for more information:

The coursera version of this class consists of 5 courses:

- Algorithms for Searching, Sorting, and Indexing
- Trees and Graphs: Basics
- Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
- Approximation Algorithms and Linear Programming
- Advanced Data Structures, RSA and Quantum Algorithms

I have noticed while taking this class that most of the time it is best to take notes by hand, on paper. Since that is the case I won't be able to upload 100% of my thoughts, but I'll upload some of the algorithms that make it out of pseudo-code and into Python.
